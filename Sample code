In this code, we use the OneWire library to communicate with the temperature sensor and the DallasTemperature library to read the temperature data. We start by initializing the sensor in the setup function and then loop through taking temperature readings and printing them to the serial monitor. The delay function is used to wait for a second before taking another reading.
